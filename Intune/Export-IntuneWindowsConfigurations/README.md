# Document and manage Microsoft Intune environment for Windows devices

## The Challenge

As Intune administrators, we often struggle with:

- Keeping track of all our configuration profiles across multiple categories
- Documenting remediation scripts and their assignments
- Creating comprehensive documentation for audits or knowledge transfer
- Having visibility into how policies are targeted across our organization

## The Solution

The "Export-IntuneWindowsConfigurations" script leverages Microsoft Graph to generate complete documentation of your Windows 10/11 Intune environment, including:

✅ All configuration profiles (device configs, settings catalog, endpoint security, etc.)

✅ Proactive remediation scripts with their full content

✅ PowerShell scripts with execution parameters

✅ Group assignments for all policies

✅ Beautifully formatted HTML reports with a summary dashboard

## Why I Find It Useful

1. Time Savings: What used to take hours of manual documentation now happens in minutes
2. Compliance: Provides audit-ready documentation of all Windows device management settings
3. Knowledge Transfer: Perfect for onboarding new team members or cross-training
4. Change Management: Run before and after major changes to document the differences
5. Security Reviews: Gives security teams a complete view of all configurations in one place

This script has become an essential part of my regular IT documentation process. If you're managing Windows devices with Intune, I highly recommend incorporating and adopting this into your toolkit. Below is the Code as is - please amend it to suit your needs.
